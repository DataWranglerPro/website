## FAQ  
- What is the data cleaning process?
	- After receiving your data file and detailed instructions on data cleaning requirements, I will begin cleaning the file, and within a couple of days deliver to you the final data file. There will be an opportunity for you to review the file and request any corrections to the file.

- What kinds of files do you accept?
	- Data files in Microsoft Excel, CSV, or TXT format.

- How do you protect sensitive data?
	- Since all work must be conducted within the secure Fiverr ecosystem, it's important to note that I cannot ensure the protection of data containing sensitive information you deem as such. However, I assure you that I will exert my utmost effort to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the data

- When does the 2 day Clock start?
	- As soon as we accept the job, we will have two business days to complete the task for you.

- Do you offer refunds for your services?
	- If you're not completely satisfied with our service, we'll refund your payment, no questions asked.

- What if there is an error or mistake on your part?
	- We take full responsibility for any errors or mistakes that may occur on our part. If such an instance arises, we will promptly rectify the issue at no additional cost to you. Our goal is to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience, and we are dedicated to making things right.

- How many rows can my files have?
	- Depending on the package you choose, the files can have almost any number of rows. We may not have the hardware to process very large files (files that have over 1 million rows) and these will have to be reviewed on a one-by-one basis by Hedaro.

- How do I know how many data files I have?
	- If you have an Excel file, we count every tab as a data file. This is mainly to prevent people from sending me files with a very large number of tabs in one Excel file. A file with a .TXT or .CSV extension will count as one data file.
