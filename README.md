## FAQ  
- What is the data cleaning process?
	- After receiving your data file and detailed instructions on data cleaning requirements, I will begin cleaning the file, and within a couple of days deliver to you the final data file. There will be an opportunity for you to review the file and request any corrections to the file.

- What kinds of files do you accept?
	- Data files in Microsoft Excel, CSV, or TXT format.

- When does the 2 day Clock start?
	- As soon as we accept the job, we will have two business days to complete the task for you.

- Do you offer refunds for your services?
	- If you're not completely satisfied with our service, we'll refund your payment, no questions asked.

- What if there is an error or mistake on your part?
	- We take full responsibility for any errors or mistakes that may occur on our part. If such an instance arises, we will promptly rectify the issue at no additional cost to you. Our goal is to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience, and we are dedicated to making things right.

- How many rows can my files have?
	- Depending on the package you choose, the files can have almost any number of rows. We may not have the hardware to process very large files (files that have over 1 million rows) and these will have to be reviewed on a one-by-one basis by Hedaro.

- How do I know how many data files I have?
	- If you have an Excel file, we count every tab as a data file. This is mainly to prevent people from sending me files with a very large number of tabs in one Excel file. A file with a .TXT or .CSV extension will count as one data file.

## Reviews
_I am not super great behind a computer but have always tried to do things myself to save money. When I can't figure things out,   
I've always just avoided them to avoid the annoyance of having to learn. Eventually you get to the point where you hire someone   
else to do something for you. That is when David Rojas came into my picture. I asked him to do a task for me that I wasn't 100%   
sure how to do, and even if I figured it out, it probably would have taken me 3-4 days to complete it. David took my excel task,   
and completely finished it in less than 10 minutes. It was totally worth my time and money spent! From now on I will always be   
calling David to get these tasks done for me. I would highly recommend him for his knowledgeable skills and quick task completions.  
Thank you so much!_ - **Mikaela R.**
